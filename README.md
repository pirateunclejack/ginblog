# ginblog

This is a go project practice whice follows this lesson: [golang ginblog](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1AA411v7e6/?spm_id_from=333.788&vd_source=98c7ca79066b6ac78d5ffc8b9d12e8a3)

I gave up to follow this lesson and end this repository. Here is the code before [lesson frontend-2.11](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Uz4y1f76J?vd_source=98c7ca79066b6ac78d5ffc8b9d12e8a3)
If you want to see all code for this project, please look at here: [gitee-ginblog](https://gitee.com/wejectchan/ginblog/tree/master)

I gave up this project because this reasons

- This lesson is based on old vue and related components.
  The usage of some components is changed. It can not run if you follow all codes in lesson videos.
  The dependency problem of different components is hard to resolve.
- The code is not elegant.
- The teacher made this lesson without good prepare. Some codes changed over and over.

Anyway, this is not a bad full stack project for beginners to learn.
